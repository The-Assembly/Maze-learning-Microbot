# Maze-learning-Microbot

In all our past workshops, we have featured large robots – either two wheeled, four wheeled, or biped. Internationally, however, regular competitions are conducted on a concept of robots known as “Micromouse”. These tiny robots, no bigger than your hand, are built for speed, agility, and their ability to learn and memorize patterns. Through this workshop, will show you how to:
- Make your own Micromouse 
- Learn how to code, manage and debug the robot
- Race the robots built at the workshop
